# 50.007 Machine Learning Project

## Steps to run our code:

1. Install Python from https://www.python.org/downloads/
2. Open our code in Visual Code Studio
3. If you want to git clone, run:
```
git clone https://github.com/yixuansaw/MachineLearningProj.git
```  
5. Install the Python extension in Visual Code Studio
6. Make you have the neccessary dependencies, if not then run
```
pip install numpy
```
5. In the terminal, typing the following command in the terminal and pressing Enter:
```
python Part1.py
```
```
python Part2.py
```
```
python Part3.py
```
6. The Python code will now run in the terminal, and you'll see the output.

# Part 1:
For Part 1, the outputs are in Data/ES/dev.p1.out and Data/RU/dev.p1.out
After executing all codes, the program will generate .out 
Navigate to EvalScript directory and check F-score by running:
```
python evalResult.py dev.out <FILENAME_HERE>
```

# Part 4:
Check Part4.ipynb for proposed solution.

I am the sole contributor to this project as my groupmates are ignoring my messages and refuse to cooperate. I wish that I can be graded individually for this submission, as it would be unfair if members who did not contribute at all get any credit. Thank you.
